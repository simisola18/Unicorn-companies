# Unicorn-companies
An Analysis of Unicorn Companies using Python.
Unicorn Companies are Private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022, including each company's current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns.
These companies have all achieved great success in their respective industries, and they are seen as leaders in the future of technology. Unicorn companies are often characterized by their innovative business models, their rapid growth, and their ability to attract top talent.
I have performed an exploratory data analysis of the dataset first doing a thorough cleaning and manipulation of the dataset to find out Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment? 2. How long does it usually take for a company to become a unicorn? Has it always been this way? 3. Which countries have the most unicorns? Are there any cities that appear to be industry hubs? 4. Which investors have funded the most unicorns?
I firstly removed missing values and replaced null values in the dataset, i also renamed some columns and created columns that would be beneficial to the analysis. My analysis aimed to answer the above which was done. Trying to get the right code was a bit of a challenge also as some errors were difficult to debug. In all it was a good learning experience.
